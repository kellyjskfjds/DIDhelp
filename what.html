			<h1> What is DID?</h1>
			<p>Dissociative identity disorder (DID), previously known as multiple personality disorder (MPD), is a mental disorder characterized by the maintenance of at least two distinct and relatively enduring personality states. The disorder is accompanied by memory gaps beyond what would be explained by ordinary forgetfulness.</p>
			<p>likely caused by many factors, including severe trauma during early childhood (usually extreme, repetitive physical, sexual, or emotional abuse).</p>
			<p>Research indicates that the cause of DID is likely a psychological response to interpersonal and environmental stresses, particularly during early childhood years when emotional neglect or abuse may interfere with personality development. As many as 99% of individuals who develop dissociative disorders have recognized personal histories of recurring, overpowering, and often life-threatening disturbances or traumas at a sensitive developmental stage of childhood (usually before age 6).</p>
			<p>There are currently no formal, evidence-based guildelines to treat DID. Many treatments are based on case reports or are even controversial. <br>
			While there's also no "cure" for dissociative identity disorder, long-term treatment can be helpful, if the patient stays committed.</p>
