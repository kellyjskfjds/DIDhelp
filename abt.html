			<h1> Information about us</h1>
			<p>We provide advice and support to empower anyone experiencing a mental health problem. We campaign to improve services, raise awareness and promote understanding.</p>
			<p>In reality 'we' is just me. just one person. I was inspired by my friend who recently told me that she believed that she had DID.<br>
			In all honesty, as much as I wanted this website to be something I can share to her, I think it is a lot better if I gave her links to resources she can use while researchng on my own to save her time.<br>
			I hope that with the information I learned from making this website will carry onto my future where I can help others who I encounter who think they have DID.
			<br>
			I enjoyed desiging this website. I wanted something a bit more different than my other websites, which normally looked a bit more linear and had the user scroll through so much information. I also wanted to work on making my website uniform with a theme.<br>
			One of the things that  was kind of disppointing was how I could not really use the navigation that I had for my previous website. It wouldve worked greatly but there was something that was not displaying right even though I copied exactly what I used before.
			<br>
			There is also an obvious problem with the placement of these boxes. My intention was to make them dead in the center but I think my screen on this laptop is smaller than usual so it's hard to gauge where the box will lie depending on different monitors.</p>
